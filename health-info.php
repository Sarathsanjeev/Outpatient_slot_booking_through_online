              <hr>
              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p class="card-text">Cancer refers to any one of a large number of diseases characterized by the development of abnormal cells that divide uncontrollably and have the ability to infiltrate and destroy normal body tissue. Cancer often has the ability to spread throughout your body.   
                  Cancer is the second-leading cause of death in the world. But survival rates are improving for many types of cancer, thanks to improvements in cancer screening, treatment and prevention.
              </p>
              <hr>
              <h3>Symptoms</h3>
              <p>Signs and symptoms caused by cancer will vary depending on what part of the body is affected.</p>
              <p>Some general signs and symptoms associated with, but not specific to, cancer, include:</p>    
              <ul>
                  <li>Fatigue</li>

                  <li>Changes in bowel or bladder habits</li>
                  <li>Persistent cough or trouble breathing</li>

              <h2 class="card-title text-center">Stroke</h2>
              <hr>
              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p class="card-text">A stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures and bleeds, or when there’s a blockage in the blood supply to the brain. The rupture or blockage prevents blood and oxygen from reaching the brain’s tissues.
              </p>
              <p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Trusted Source, stroke is a leading cause of death in the United States. Every year, more than 795,000 U.S. people have a stroke.</p>
              <p>Without oxygen, brain cells and tissue become damaged and begin to die within minutes.</p>
              <hr>
              <h3>Symptoms</h3>
              <p>The loss of blood flow to the brain damages tissues within the brain. Symptoms of a stroke show up in the body parts controlled by the damaged areas of the brain.</p> 
              <p>The sooner a person having a stroke gets care, the better their outcome is likely to be. For this reason, it’s helpful to know the signs of a stroke so you can act quickly. Stroke symptoms can include:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>paralysis</li>
                  <li>numbness or weakness in the arm, face, and leg, especially on one side of the body</li>
                  <li>trouble speaking or understanding others</li>
                  </li>slurred speech</li>
                  <li>confusion, disorientation, or lack of responsiveness</li>
                  <li>sudden behavioral changes, especially increased agitation</li>

              <h2 class="card-title text-center">Diabetes</h2>
              <hr>
              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p class="card-text">Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood glucose. Hyperglycaemia, also called raised blood glucose or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels.</p>
              <p>In 2014, 8.5% of adults aged 18 years and older had diabetes. In 2019, diabetes was the direct cause of 1.5 million deaths and 48% of all deaths due to diabetes occurred before the age of 70 years. Another 460 000 kidney disease deaths were caused by diabetes, and raised blood glucose causes around 20% of cardiovascular deaths</p>
              <p>Between 2000 and 2019, there was a 3% increase in age-standardized mortality rates from diabetes. In lower-middle-income countries, the mortality rate due to diabetes increased</p>
              <p>By contrast, the probability of dying from any one of the four main noncommunicable diseases (cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases or diabetes) between the ages of 30 and 70 decreased by 22% globally between 2000 and 2019</p>
              <hr>
              <h3>Symptoms</h3>
              <ul>
                  <li>Urinate (pee) a lot, often at night.</li>
                  <li>Are very thirsty.</li>
                  <li>Lose weight without trying.</li>
                  </li>Are very hungry.</li>
                  <li>Have blurry vision.</li>
                  <li>Have numb or tingling hands or feet.</li>

              <hr>
              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious illness that mainly affects the lungs. The germs that cause tuberculosis are a type of bacteria.</p>
              <p>Tuberculosis can spread when a person with the illness coughs, sneezes or sings. This can put tiny droplets with the germs into the air. Another person can then breathe in the droplets, and the germs enter the lungs</p>
              <p>Tuberculosis spreads easily where people gather in crowds or where people live in crowded conditions. People with HIV/AIDS and other people with weakened immune systems have a higher risk of catching tuberculosis than people with typical immune systems</p>
              <p>Drugs called antibiotics can treat tuberculosis. But some forms of the bacteria no longer respond well to treatments.</p>

              <hr>
              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) targets the immune system and weakens people's defense against many infections and some types of cancer that people with healthy immune systems can more easily fight off. As the virus destroys and impairs the function of immune cells, infected individuals gradually become immunodeficient. Immune function is typically measured by CD4 cell count.</p>
              <p>The most advanced stage of HIV infection is acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which can take many years to develop if not treated, depending on the individual. AIDS is defined by the development of certain cancers, infections or other severe long-term clinical manifestations</p>
